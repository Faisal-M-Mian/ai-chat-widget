# DEPLOYMENT FIX - ROOT CAUSE FOUND ✅

## Problem Identified From Build Logs
The container build was failing at the `npm run build` step because:
1. **`esbuild` dependency missing** - Required for server bundling but removed by `npm prune --production`
2. **Build sequence error** - Dependencies pruned BEFORE build step completed
3. **Health check misconfigured** - Wrong endpoint causing container health failures

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Build Process
- **Removed `npm prune --production`** - Keeps esbuild available for server build
- **Added proper health check** with `/health` endpoint
- **Enhanced container logging** for better debugging

### 2. Added Health Monitoring
- **New `/health` endpoint** in server routes for container health checks
- **Fixed healthcheck.js** with correct hostname (`127.0.0.1`) and path (`/health`)
- **Proper timeout and error handling** for health monitoring

### 3. Enhanced Server Startup
- **Added comprehensive logging** with timestamps for startup debugging
- **Better error handling** for process management
- **Improved server binding** for Docker environment

## Files Modified ✅
- `Dockerfile` - Removed problematic npm prune, added health check
- `server/routes.ts` - Added `/health` endpoint
- `healthcheck.js` - Fixed hostname and endpoint path  
- `server/index.ts` - Enhanced logging and error handling

## Verification Complete ✅
- **Health endpoint working**: `curl localhost:5000/health` returns healthy status
- **Server starts successfully**: No esbuild errors in local testing
- **All dependencies available**: Build process has required tools

## Deploy Instructions
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Docker build failure - remove npm prune and add health endpoint"
git push
```

Then redeploy in Coolify.

## Expected Results ✅
- ✅ **Docker build succeeds** - No more esbuild missing errors
- ✅ **Container starts healthy** - Health checks pass immediately  
- ✅ **Service stays running** - No more crash loops
- ✅ **Widget fully functional** at https://chatwidget.datagen.agency
- ✅ **Chat connects to n8n** webhook successfully

The deployment should now work perfectly with no container health issues!
